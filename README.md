# Virtual Fitting Room Project

## Introduction

This repository contains the implementation of the Virtual Fitting Room project. Our work aims to develop a solution that allows users to virtually try on clothes, providing a novel shopping experience that bridges the gap between online and physical retail.

This project is based on our paper: [title of the paper](link to the paper).

## What We Have Done

Here, provide a brief overview of the work you have done in the project. Discuss the models you have built, the challenges you have faced, and the solutions you have come up with.

## Metrics Calculation

The `metrics` directory contains code for calculating various performance metrics of our models. Below is a description of the main scripts:

- `metric1.py`: This script calculates metric 1. Here is how to run it:
python metric1.py --input=<input_file> --model=<model_file>
- `metric2.py`: This script calculates metric 2. Here is how to run it:
python metric2.py --input=<input_file> --model=<model_file>

## Test Results

The `results` directory contains the test results of our models. Below is a summary of these results:

- **Model 1**: 

  - Metric 1: xx.xx
  - Metric 2: xx.xx
  - Summary of the performance of the model, and any insights you have gained from these results.

- **Model 2**: 

  - Metric 1: xx.xx
  - Metric 2: xx.xx
  - Summary of the performance of the model, and any insights you have gained from these results.
